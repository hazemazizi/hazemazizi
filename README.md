# 🚀 Hey, I’m [Azizi Hazem]!

I’m a full-stack dev with a passion for crafting slick web apps and tackling optimization puzzles. I live at the intersection of code and chaos—think Spring Boot, Angular, MongoDB, and a dash of AI-driven security. When I’m not slinging code, I’m deep in operations research, unraveling scheduling mysteries with genetic algorithms and metaheuristics.

Right now, I’m building **TimeForge**—a next-level project management tool packed with real-time tracking, AI-powered security, and productivity vibes. Plus, I’m nerding out on Flow-Shop Scheduling Problems (FSSP) to benchmark and optimize like a boss.

## 🌟 What’s Cooking?
- **TimeForge**: A powerhouse PM tool with task tracking, AI security, and well-being features to keep your team thriving.  
- **AI Security**: Keystroke dynamics for admin authentication—because I like my apps locked down tighter than a vault.  
- **Operations Research**: Benchmarking exact and approximation algorithms for Flow-Shop Scheduling. (Scheduling nerds, unite!)  

## 🎯 Goals & Quests
- Evolving **TimeForge** from a monolith to a microservices beast for its AI goodies.  
- Leveling up my metaheuristic game for scheduling domination.  
- Supercharging AI-based behavioral auth for bulletproof security.
