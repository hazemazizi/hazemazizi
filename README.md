## Hi there 👋
🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on full-stack web development and optimization problems. My expertise spans Spring Boot, Angular, and MongoDB, with a keen interest in AI-driven security and operations research.

Currently, I'm working on TimeForge, a project management tool integrating real-time tracking, AI-powered security, and productivity-enhancing features. Additionally, I'm researching scheduling problems in operations research, particularly Flow-Shop Scheduling, using genetic algorithms and metaheuristics for benchmarking and optimization.

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: Angular (v18), HTML/CSS, TypeScript
Backend: Spring Boot, Java, MongoDB
Security: Spring Security, AI-based keystroke dynamics for authentication
DevOps: Docker, Microservices (in progress)
Research & AI: Optimization algorithms, metaheuristics, AI-based security
🏆 Current Projects
TimeForge: A full-featured project management tool with task tracking, AI security, and well-being features.
AI-Based Security: Implementing keystroke dynamics to enhance admin authentication in TimeForge.
Operations Research: Studying and benchmarking exact and approximation algorithms for Flow-Shop Scheduling Problems (FSSP).
📚 Learning & Goals
Transitioning TimeForge from a monolithic Spring Boot app to a microservices architecture for AI components.
Improving my knowledge of metaheuristic algorithms and their applications in scheduling problems.
Enhancing AI-based behavioral authentication for better security implementations.
